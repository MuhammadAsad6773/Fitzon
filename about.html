    <p>
      FitZone was created with a simple idea: fitness should be practical, welcoming, and results-driven. 
      We focus on real training, not trends, and help our members build habits they can maintain long term.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re stepping into a gym for the first time or refining years of training, 
      FitZone offers a supportive environment where progress is measured by effort and consistency.
